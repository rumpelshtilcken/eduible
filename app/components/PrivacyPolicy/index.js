    <p>
      We at Eduible Inc. (collectively with any subsidiaries, &quot;Eduible&quot;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
      or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding
      information we collect through our mobile apps, mobile features, web sites, including
      www.eduible.com, applications and any other interactive features or services owned or
      controlled by Eduible that post a link to this Privacy Policy (each, a &quot;Service&quot; and
      collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;), as well as any information we collect offline and
      combine in our databases. Certain features discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered
      on each Service at any particular time. Note that we combine the information we collect from
      you through all of our mobile applications, websites, and other Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note about Children: Our Services are not intended for, marketed to or available to
      individuals younger than the age of 13, and individuals younger than the age of 13 should not
      submit personal information to us or use any Service.

    <p>
      SUMMARY<br />
      WE FULLY DESCRIBE OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES BELOW IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. THIS SUMMARY PROVIDES AN
      OVERVIEW OF SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING OUR USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND
      THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY SERVE ADVERTISEMENTS AND WHO MAY SET COOKIES OR WEB BEACONS OR SIMILAR
      TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY VERY
      CAREFULLY. BY USING ANY SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ITS ENTIRETY.
    </p>

    <p>
      We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your
      relationship with Eduible, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us
      or on behalf of certain third parties. It also includes providing offers to you based on
      information you provide or we collect, or your use of the Services. Note that we do not share
      your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your
      consent; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances.<br />
      As permissible under applicable law, we may work with network advertisers, analytics service
      providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the Services,
      to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed
      and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other
      web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information
      regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if
      you click on a Eduible advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us the
      advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. You may also see
      third party ads or in-house ads run by Eduible on the Services. The advertisements you see may
      be served by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the
      Services, and other web sites and services, to provide you targeted advertising based upon
      your interests. Our ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service
      providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices and they may
      otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your visits to and activity on
      the Services, as well as on other web sites or online services. Some of these parties may
      collect Personal Information when you visit the Services or other websites and services.
      Please review &quot;THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS&quot; for additional
      information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a
      self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for
      this purpose. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will
      continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online.
    </p>

    <p>
      INFORMATION COLLECTION<br />
      Registration and Other Information You Provide<br />
      The Services may collect &quot;Personal Information&quot; (which is information that can
      reasonably be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to
      identify or contact a specific individual. Personal Information includes, but is not limited
      to your name, email address, phone number, physical address or zip code, account information
      (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your
      account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate)
      and information about your interests and preferences. We may also collect payment information
      (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services
      through the Services. Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as
      Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your Profile<br />
      Note that in order to provide services to you, educational organizations and other third
      parties may be able to review certain information in your Profile for some of the Services,
      whether or not you have limited public access to that information, to the extent permitted by
      applicable law. You may have the opportunity to control whether this information is shared,
      but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the mobile site,
      website or other service where you created your Profile. Eduible does not share your contact
      information (email, full postal address or phone number) with third parties unless you request
      or agree to that sharing. However, if permitted by applicable law, Eduible may send you
      information and offers from third parties and information about the Services, and you may not
      be able to opt-out from these messages without closing your account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You<br />
      Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third
      party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward
      information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or
      service, such as enabling you to &quot;like&quot; a product within our Services or
      &quot;share&quot; content to other web sites. If you choose to &quot;like&quot; or
      &quot;share&quot; content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third
      party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the
      third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services.
      Similarly, if you publically post information on a third party platform that references
      Eduible or one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with
      terms of that third party. These features may collect your IP address or other Device
      Identifier, which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the
      third party feature to function properly. Third party features and applications are either
      hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these
      features are governed by the privacy policy(ies) of the company(ies) providing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our
      Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with
      another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one
      of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or
      service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about
      you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to remove the application
      or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the
      application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. When you
      choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third
      party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our
      Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with
      that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on eduible.com with your
      connections on the third party website). In some instances, we may require that you
      participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose
      not to authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able
      to use the applicable Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and
      stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including
      whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information
      shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site
      and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case
      we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may
      retain the information previously collected in compliance with all applicable laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      In compliance with all applicable laws, we also may supplement the information we collect with
      outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods
      you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to
      offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to
      you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we
      collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the
      combined information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Referral Features<br />
      The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends
      to use the Services using a one-time email. Eduible stores this information for the purpose of
      verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. Eduible will not use
      those referred email addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user
      comes to a Service and registers as a user, in which case we may use the email address
      provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may
      contact us via email at support@eduible.com to request that we remove this information from
      our active database.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information Eduible Collects Automatically When You Access The Services<br />
      Like other mobile apps, web sites and online services, we and our analytics providers, vendors
      and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain &quot;Usage
      Information&quot; whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by
      viewing information about a college or university; clicking, tapping, or &ldquo;swiping&rdquo;
      content; exchanges messages with Eduible coaches, representatives of institutions, or other
      users; completing in-app polls or surveys; viewing content on the Services; searching for an
      institution, topic, or other information; or by clicking on an advertisement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or
      advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered
      into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within
      our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time
      of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a
      variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special
      offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to
      enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (&quot;Device
      Identifier&quot;) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a &quot;Device&quot;)
      you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically
      assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its
      Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party
      service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to
      access a Service, internet service provider (ISP), date and time of your visit, browser
      language, browser type, referring and exit pages and URLs, amount of time spent on particular
      pages, which parts of our Services you use, which links you click, search terms, operating
      system, traffic and related statistics, keywords, and/or other general browsing or usage data.
      Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific
      and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:</p>

    <p>
      Cookies: Our Services utilize Cookies to improve your current and future experience by
      allowing us to understand your usage of our Services. For example, cookies help our systems
      recognize you if you return to our Services shortly after exiting them. Cookies are small text
      files stored on your computer that allow us to personalize the content of our Services.
      Cookies can be turned off via your browser settings if you so choose. However, if you turn
      your cookies off, some features of our Services may not function properly. In our Products, we
      use local storage to help remember your settings and account configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Services utilize Cookies to improve your current and future experience by allowing us to
      understand your usage of our Services. For example, cookies help our systems recognize you if
      you return to our Services shortly after exiting them. Cookies are small text files stored on
      your computer that allow us to personalize the content of our Services. On third party
      browsers, cookies can be turned off via your browser settings if you so choose. However, if
      you turn your cookies off, some features of our Services may not function properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Web Beacons: We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third
      parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs),
      that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is
      effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to
      cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program. In
      contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user&rsquo;s computer hard drive, clear gifs are
      embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this
      sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our
      Services. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' Personal
      Information.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Embedded Script: is programming code that is designed to collect information about your
      interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily
      downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service
      provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.<br />
      In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for
      security and fraud detection purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flash &amp; HTML5: We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content,
      information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on
      our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML
      5 &amp; Flash to collect and store information.<br />
      Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
    </p>

    <p>
      How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals:<br />
      Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a &quot;Do Not
      Track&quot; (DNT) signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference
      that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not
      want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or
      online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as
      the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT,
      and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. To find out more about &quot;Do Not
      Track&quot;, please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
    </p>

    <p>
      HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br />
      We use information about you, including Personal Information, the information you provide in
      your Profile, User Content, and Usage Information to: (1) allow you to participate in features
      we offer or to provide related customer service, including, without limitation, to respond to
      your questions, complaints or comments; (2) tailor content, recommendations and offers we

      your information or otherwise with your consent. Our use of your information will comply with
      all applicable state and federal laws. Note that because state laws vary regarding the use of
      Personal Information, our practices may vary as to different users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that information submitted on the Services via a &quot;Contact Us&quot; or other
      similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided via
      these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you
      agree otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      INFORMATION SHARING<br />
      Eduible does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing
      purposes without your consent and in compliance with all applicable laws (including California
      Business &amp; Professions Code section 22584 (&quot;SOPIPA&quot;), and California Education
      Code section 49073.1). Eduible may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate or
      de-identified user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third
      parties, including advertisers, content providers, and analytics providers; and third parties
      may collect non-Personal Information when you visit the Services. We also may share your
      Personal Information with third parties with your consent (if permissible under applicable
      law), as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, and as described below or
      otherwise in this Privacy Policy:
    </p>

    <p>
      Educational Institutions:We work with colleges, universities, scholarship providers and
      educational institutions (&quot;Educational Institutions&quot;) to provide targeted recruiting
      and outreach to some of our members. For some of our Services, we may allow Educational
      Institutions to review information in your Profile (such as hometown, grade point average, and
      graduation year), whether or not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that
      information. (Note, however, that it is up to you whether or not to fill out your Profile.) We
      do not share your contact information (email address, full postal address or phone number)
      with these Educational Institutions without your consent, but we may send you information on
      their behalf. This is a fundamental element of some of our free Services. In addition, you may
      indicate that you would like to receive additional information from Educational Institutions
      or other third parties and we will then share your information with those parties so that they
      may contact you per your request. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and
      practices of third parties. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive
      communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      When You Request That We Share Your Information: In compliance with all applicable laws, we
      may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are brought to you by a third
      party or that otherwise involve sharing your information with a third party. If you request or
      agree at that time to have your information shared, your information will be disclosed to that
      third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third
      party. This includes, without limitation, instances in which you use our Services to purchase
      products or services provided, in whole or part, by third parties, such as when you use our
      Service to order food from a local restaurant. You also may request, sometimes through your
      use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we share information
      about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with third parties to provide
      services to us or you in connection with the Services, but subject to applicable law and
      confidentiality obligations which limit their use and disclosure of such information. For
      example, we may provide your Personal Information to companies that provide services to help
      us with our business activities, such as sending our emails or offering customer service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Administrative, Legal Reasons &amp; Academic Integrity Investigations. We may also disclose
      your information, including Personal Information, in response to a subpoena, court order, or
      when otherwise required by law; in response to bankruptcy proceedings; to defend our rights;
      in response to a request from law enforcement; to provide information to a claimed owner of
      intellectual property who claims that content you have provided to us infringes on their
      rights; upon request of an academic institution connected to an investigation into academic
      integrity; to protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable
      to the Services; or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any
      organization or individual. We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to
      identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service
      providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. These
      disclosures may be carried out without your consent or without notice to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Business Transitions. Eduible may share Personal Information with its parent, subsidiaries and
      affiliates, and investors (or prospective investors) primarily for business and operational
      purposes so long as any recipient agrees to comply with this Privacy Policy and applicable law
      with regard to such Personal Information. In the event that Eduible goes through a business
      transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of
      its assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the
      course of any due diligence process, your information, including Personal Information, will
      likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent
      notice on Services of any completed change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information,
      as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy
      will become binding upon the new owner of the information until amended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions
      (each a &quot;Promotion&quot;) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion,
      you are agreeing to governing terms, conditions or official rules, which may contain specific
      requirements of you, including allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name,
      voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the
      Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information, such as your name and
      shipping address, may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the
      administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner
      selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official
      rules, such as on a winners list.
    </p>

    <p>
      THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS<br />
      We may work with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other
      vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the Services; to provide us with
      information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions
      users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other websites, within
      mobile apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the
      Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. We will conduct these activities in
      compliance with applicable laws, which may vary by state. As an example of how we may receive
      or provide information, if you click on a Eduible advertisement, our service provider(s) may
      be able to tell us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the
      advertisement; likewise, if you click on an ad you see on our Services, our service
      provider(s) may be able to tell which page you were visiting on our Services and may pass that
      information to the advertiser. The advertisements you see may be served by one or more third
      parties, who may use information collected over time about your activities on the Services,
      and other websites and services, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
      interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program
      that allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may
      access that opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served
      advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere
      online. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies,
      analytics providers and other vendors. Our ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies,
      analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices
      (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to
      information about you and your online browsing activities. Some of these third parties may
      collect Personal Information over time when you visit the Services or other web sites and
      services.
    </p>

    <p>
      MOBILE USE<br />
      Your mobile Device Identifier, your mobile carrier, and your physical location may be
      transmitted to Eduible. You agree that Eduible may store and use that information for security
      purposes (for example, for user verification or authentication and to ensure that our APIs are
      being used appropriately). If you wish to no longer allow Eduible to track your physical
      locations you may turn this off within your device settings. You may be able to opt-in to

      California Residents - Your CA Privacy Rights<br />
      Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have
      the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third
      parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during
      the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes and the categories of
      personal information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company that
      has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing
      personal information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes may
      instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. Eduible qualifies for the
      alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Eduible
      provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their
      direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time
      Eduible offers that choice, Eduible does not share your information with that identified third
      party for its direct marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to
      sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to
      exercise choice, please send your request via email by clicking here or write to us at the
      following mailing address: Eduible, 1929 Crisanto Ave, Mountain View, CA 94040. You must put
      the statement &quot;Your California Privacy Rights&quot; in the subject field of your e-mail

      for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
